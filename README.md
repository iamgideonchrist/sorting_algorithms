# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn about sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, and so on) and Big O Notation in **C language**.

## Apparatus
### General
* Used `vi` as editor
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All files end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Codes use the `Betty` style
* No global variables were used
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Prototypes of all functions are included in the header file called `sort.h`
